# Credit cards clustering analysis

## In this project, I made an analysis about the credit cards available in Colombia. I wanted to find in how many cluster I would be to able split all of the costumers. This analysis is a little bit limited because it has only 234 records, if there were more records, it would be better for the clustering model. However, you will find some visualizations that it will gave you information and this information can be useful to create new products for target customers and so that you understand the market
